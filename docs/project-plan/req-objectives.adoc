= Requirements and objectives

== Objectives
To reduce friction and misunderstanding in the project, the targets are defined following the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria[SMART criteria]. Targets should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. This way targets can be checked at any given point of time during the project.

In addition to defining the targets it is also important to state the non-targets that are not going to be achieved by the project.

== Comparison and prioritisation of competing objectives
It is important to be aware of the relationships in between objectives. In general the relationship between two objectives can be differentiated into identical, complementary, neutral, competing and contradictory objective relationships. Objectives that contradict or compete with each other require an analysis and prioritisation in cooperation with the contractor.

// TODO check if there are any contradictory objectives in the project and add a table for them
There are no contradictory objectives in this project. Following competing objectives were spotted and prioritised:
